# Data Analysis of Courses offered by Udemy and edX
This project is a data analysis of online courses available on two popular platforms, Udemy and edX. The goal of this analysis is to gain insights into the courses offered by these platforms based on factors such as price, subject, and number of subscribers. The data for this project was sourced from Kaggle, which provides information on over 13,000 courses from Udemy and more than 3,800 courses from edX.
The project includes a variety of data cleaning techniques, data manipulation, and data visualization methods to gain insights into the data. Some of the key questions that this project aims to answer include:

> What are the most popular subjects on Udemy and edX?
> What insights can we gain from analyzing the enrollment trends of courses over time?
> How does the price of courses vary by subject and platform?
> Which platform has a higher average number of subscribers per course?

Through this analysis, we hope to gain a better understanding of the online course landscape and provide insights that can be useful to both learners and course creators.
# Data Analysis Tools
Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn combined with SQL queries to analyze and visualize the data.
